# High-Performance Distributed Task Scheduler Using gRPC

## Overview
A high-performance distributed task scheduler leveraging gRPC to facilitate efficient communication across multiple nodes. The system optimizes task distribution and execution in a scalable, fault-tolerant, and dynamic manner.

## Features
- **Low Latency and High Throughput**: Using gRPC and shared memory for efficient communication and data sharing.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling by adding worker nodes.
- **Advanced Scheduling Algorithms**: Ensuring optimal task allocation and resource utilization.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Robust mechanisms for fault detection and task reassignment.

## Architecture
The system architecture includes the following components:
- **Client**: Submits tasks and handles asynchronous task responses.
- **Worker**: Executes tasks and sends heartbeat signals to the Register.
- **Process Lifecycle Manager (PLM)**: Manages task queue and task-worker mappings.
- **Main Scheduler**: Allocates tasks using advanced scheduling algorithms.
- **Register**: Maintains a registry of clients and workers, monitoring system health.

## Communication Protocol and Data Flow
1. **Task Submission**: Client submits tasks to PLM using `submitTask` gRPC method.
2. **Task Assignment**: Main Scheduler assigns tasks to workers.
3. **Task Execution and Result Reporting**: Workers execute tasks and report results via heartbeat messages.
4. **Result Delivery**: PLM sends task results to the client.
5. **Failure Handling**: Register detects worker failures and informs PLM for task reassignment.

## Performance and Scalability
- **Shared Memory**: Used for task and worker heaps, enabling quick access and updates.
- **gRPC Communication**: Provides efficient, low-latency communication between components.

## Implementation Details
### Shared Memory
- **Initialization**: Using POSIX system calls.
- **Data Structures**: Priority queues for task and worker heaps.
- **Synchronization**: Mutexes and semaphores ensure data consistency.
- **Memory Barriers**: Prevent CPU memory operation reordering.

### gRPC Services
- **Multiple Services**: Dedicated to specific communication pathways.

### Phase 2: Refinement of PLM and Scheduler Integration
- Enhanced task ID assignment and queue management, integrated advanced scheduling algorithms.

### Phase 3: Optimization and Concurrency Management
- Replaced MPI with shared memory reading, introduced centralized management, enhanced locking mechanisms.

### Phase 4: Consolidation and Integration of PLM into gRPC
- Moved task assignment to Main Scheduler, optimized shared memory usage.

### Phase 5: Final Optimization and Full Communication Establishment
- Implemented comprehensive gRPC communication, real-time monitoring, and sophisticated task reassignment strategies.
